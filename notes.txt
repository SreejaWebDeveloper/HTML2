HTML is used for the content or structure of the web page .It includes links,tables,data,forms,images,media etc..,

Every thing in HTML is done by Tags.
<tagname>---->open tag 
</tagname>---->close tag
Whole HTML is in html element. Inside HTML element, you will have head and body elements

<h1>--->h1 is open tag
content
</h1>--->h1 is close Tag
