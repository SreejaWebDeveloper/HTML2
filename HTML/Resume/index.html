                            <p>A Human Resource Management System Project in Django, Keeps track of all of the employee’s information and data. We have created all of the employee's crud (create, read, update, and delete) operations.

                                Moving on, This is a role-based module in which the admin can perform any operation on the data, yet the employee can only see his or her own data, so access label limitations have been added to the project.
                                
                                Anyway, It has Admin side which allows extra features like manage employee, attendance, leave, department, recruitment and payroll.</p>

                                <p>This Garbage Level Monitoring System Project in Django created based on python, Django, and SQLITE3 Database.

                                    When the garbage reaches its maximum capacity, a notification will be sent to the corporation’s office, and staff will be able to take action to empty bin
